## The main idea of the article 

Comprehensively review recent research from the past decade examining the relationship between educational enrollment, attainment and fertility in Europe. It discusses how theoretical frameworks have evolved over time to explain the linkages between education and fertility decisions.  

## How does this related to our project?

This article would be highly useful for my project in several ways. First, it provides an overview of the development of theories around how factors like opportunity costs, status seeking, and post-materialist values shape how education influences childbearing choices. Understanding these mechanisms is important for framing my own analysis. Second, its systematic review of empirical studies on associations between education and fertility outcomes like timing and quantum across European countries and over time would give me insights on trends, patterns and results to consider in building my models. It also thoroughly discusses challenges in measurement and methodology that I can learn from to strengthen my own research design. Finally, its synthesis of findings on how contextual moderators like policies, gender norms and economic cycles shape education-fertility links provides a framework to situate my country-level analysis. 

## Potential shortcoming

One potential shortcoming is that most existing studies reviewed, in line with traditional data limitations, focus only on women's education and its links to their fertility. However, my project aims to analyze patterns for both female and male fertility by educational level. The article could have discussed the still relatively limited literature on men's education and fertility in more depth. Another limitation is that while it acknowledges the role of country policies, the discussion of policy frameworks as moderators is brief. As a central aspect of my analysis is to examine how specific policy designs moderate education-fertility relationships, more in-depth examination in this area could have been included. Overall, my analysis aims to address these gaps by including analysis of male fertility and conducting a deeper policy-focused examination across countries.
