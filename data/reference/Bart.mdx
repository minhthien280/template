## The main idea of the article 

Declining global fertility rates have prompted increased focus on family building rather than just family planning, given the implications of population decline. The article presents a consensus document from the International Federation of Fertility Societies outlining major trends observed in changes to global population patterns, the various factors influencing declining fertility rates worldwide, the substantial burden of infertility on individuals and societies, and the considerable disparities that exist in access to fertility care services between different countries and regions. 

## How does this related to our project?

This article would be useful for the project as it provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of fertility trends seen globally. The insights presented are relevant to the project's goals of predicting how societal indicators may evolve based on fertility rate projections. Specifically, the article touches on the potential economic and social impacts of declining populations as fertility falls below replacement levels. It also emphasizes the importance of implementing family-friendly policies and equitable access to fertility care services to help address challenges arising from population decline. The policy recommendations made could help inform the project's own recommendations.  

## Potential shortcoming

A potential shortcoming of the article from the perspective of the project is that it presents more of a high-level synthesis of existing literature through a narrative review process rather than conducting new in-depth empirical analysis. While it outlines major trends, the project could build upon this by developing more quantitative modeling of how specific societal indicators may change precisely based on fertility projections for different world regions. Additional primary data collection may also be required to thoroughly inform concrete policy guidance around improving global access to fertility care in a manner that accounts for each country or region's unique circumstances.
