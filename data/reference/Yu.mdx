summary: Social norms significantly impact individuals' fertility intentions in China
---

## The main idea of the article 

Social norms significantly impact individuals' fertility intentions in China. The authors develop a theoretical framework where macro-level factors like modernization and policy shape social norms. These social norms then directly influence fertility intentions at the individual level. Using data from the China Family Panel Studies, the study finds that both neighborhood norms and norms within social groups affect a person's intentions. The effects of norms varied based on gender, residence type (rural vs. urban), and life stage (married vs. not).  

## How does this related to our project?

This article would be extremely useful for my research project that aims to predict how different socioeconomic indicators influence fertility intentions in China. The theoretical model presented provides a framework to link macro influences to micro behaviors through meso-level social norms. This bridges insights from demography and sociology in a manner directly applicable to my studies. By showing social norms matter differently for men/women and by residence, the findings suggest variables should be interacted to better model intentions. Understanding regional variation in norms could help explain geographic differences in fertility patterns. The evidence that norms shape intentions even after controlling for individual attributes demonstrates the importance of considering social influence.  

## Potential shortcoming

One potential shortcoming is that the study only analyzes the impact of current norms and does not examine how quickly norms adapt to policy changes over time. My research could build on this by including data from before and after China's recent policy shifts to the two-child and three-child policies. This would provide insight into the intensity and durability of social norm effects. Additionally, while the article examines a few individual traits like gender, residence type, and marital status, it does not consider a wide range of other socioeconomic characteristics such as income, education levels, homeownership, and their potential interactive effects. Studying additional individual-level variables and interactions could offer deeper understanding of intention determinants. Overall, though, this paper offers a strong theoretical basis and empirical support for the importance of social factors, providing a foundation my own analyses can extend.
