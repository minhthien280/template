## The main idea of the article 

The main idea is to develop and estimate an empirical model that examines the relationship between fertility and economic development. The study suggests that a decrease in population growth is associated with an increase in GDP per capita growth. It also highlights the influence of human capital levels on fertility choices and emphasizes that income per capita grows faster in developed countries due to lower fertility rates. 

## How does this related to our project?

It provides empirical evidence on how changes in population growth, influenced by fertility, impact GDP per capita growth. The findings could offer valuable insights into the predictive power of fertility on economic development. The discussion on human capital's role in fertility decisions is relevant for understanding the dynamics between economic indicators and fertility rates. 

## Potential shortcoming

Shortcoming include the potential confounding variables that might affect the relationship between fertility and economic development. Discussing the generalizability of the findings to different cultural and regional contexts would contribute to the broader applicability of the results.
