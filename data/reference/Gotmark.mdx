## The main idea of the article 

The article summarized the research done on surveyed data on the fertility rate in relation to 5 factors: education, economy, religiosity, contraceptive prevalence rate, and family planning programs in 6 regions: E Europe, W Europe and related countries, Latin America and the Caribbean, the Arab States, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Asia. - A lot of good ideas and proof to quote in the report 

## How does this related to our project?

Showing the relation between fertility and one of the factors above. Then there is a table showing the correlation between factors. 

## Potential shortcoming

This report grouping in regions, which produces very tight and related graph. This doesn’t predict the future but try to have a regression model for each region and factor. This also focuses on single correlation, no statistical testing or multivariate model.
