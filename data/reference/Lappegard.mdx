## The main idea of the article 

There are three dimensions to how gender role attitudes relate to fertility intentions: attitudes towards gender roles in public sphere, attitudes towards mothers' roles in the family, and attitudes towards fathers' roles in the family. The authors argue these three dimensions should be distinguished and empirically investigated separately.  there are three dimensions to how gender role attitudes relate to fertility intentions: attitudes towards gender roles in public sphere, attitudes towards mothers' roles in the family, and attitudes towards fathers' roles in the family.

## How does this related to our project?

This article would be useful for my project in several ways. First, it emphasizes the need to consider different dimensions of gender attitudes rather than treating it as a single continuum from traditional to egalitarian. This multidimensional approach aligns with my goal to have a nuanced understanding of how societal factors impact fertility. Second, the article uses large cross-national survey data to empirically test relationships between the three attitude dimensions and fertility intentions, providing an example of how to operationalize variables and analyze relationships. This could inform the operationalization and analysis in my project. Lastly, the findings that relationships varied by gender, country, and parity highlights the importance of considering these factors in my own analysis of how economic, education, health systems relate to fertility. 

## Potential shortcoming

One potential shortcoming is that the article only examined intention rather than progressing to actual fertility outcomes. While intentions are useful, analyzing actual fertility would provide more definitive conclusions. Additionally, using cross-sectional data limits the ability to make claims about causal direction of relationships. A longitudinal analysis tracking changes in attitudes and subsequent fertility behavior could help address this. Lastly, the article focused on eight European countries, so generalizability may be limited. Including a more globally diverse sample in my own study could help address this.
