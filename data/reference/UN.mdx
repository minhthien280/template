## The main idea of the article 

The article talks about how the number of babies born globally is going down over time and investigates the why. It discusses the past, present, and future of how many babies people are having worldwide, considering things like money, education, and living in cities. It also mentions how government policies can affect the number of babies. 

## How does this related to our project?

It gives us an idea of why people are having fewer babies and what might happen in the future. Also, it helps us understand how policies can change how many babies are born. 

## Potential shortcoming

The article has some issues. It predicts future baby numbers, but these predictions might not be very accurate. It also doesn't dive deep into different cultures or areas that could impact baby trends. Improving it would mean recognizing that predicting future baby numbers is hard and considering more about how different cultures and places play a role.
