## The main idea of the article 

Family policies can influence fertility rates, but their effects depend on the type of policies. The authors distinguished between policies supporting work-family balance (earner-carer policies) versus traditional stay-at-home-mother policies (traditional-family policies). Using regression analyses of 33 countries from 1995-2011, they found earner-carer policies were positively linked to higher fertility, while traditional-family policies showed no link.  

## How does this related to our project?

This article would be useful for my project because it directly examines the relationship between family policies and fertility, which is the main topic of my project. It establishes that work-family balance policies may increase fertility, informing how policies could potentially achieve my goal of understanding fertility influences. The differentiated policy dimensions framework could be applied to understand varying impacts.  

## Potential shortcoming

A potential shortcoming is the limited number of time periods, reducing ability to assess policy impacts. Additionally, lack of daycare data for all countries may influence results. My project could improve on this by obtaining longer time series data, where available, to better isolate policy effects. I will also consider additional control variables like gender attitudes that prior research identifies as relevant to fertility but were not included here. uctive preferences and behaviors. My mixed-methods case study design addresses these shortcomings by examining sub-national heterogeneities and a more comprehensive array of explanatory variables, including qualitative assessments. Field interviews and focus groups will provide textual data to complement quantitative survey responses. Thus a more nuanced understanding of fertility decision-making may be achieved at the community level, building on but also improving the broad national-scale perspective offered by this article.
